# Apple II Arduino

This is forked from dpeckett's 6502/AppleII sim for an Arduino Uno. I'm going to
try to get this working on a Teensy 4, which is MUCH faster than an Uno, with the
silly goal of enabling Apple II mode *on my keyboard*. I love the idea of being
able to play Karateka when I'm bored...

Mr. Peckett originally claimed that this is 5 to 8 times slower than real hardware
but I'm betting on that Teensy 4 chip, it's already gonna be dramatically faster
than realtime.

Progress: I forked the repo. I have bigger fish to fry, but I'll get back to this,
I promise :D
